# How to Install Tailwind CSS v4 (Step-by-Step Guide)

Tailwind CSS v4 is a major release that simplifies the setup process — no more `postcss.config.js`, no `tailwind.config.js` (unless you want one), and no build tools required for many projects.

It’s designed to just work with modern CSS, providing a cleaner, faster developer experience.

## 🚀 What’s New in v4 Setup

✅ No tailwind.config.js by default — Configuration now happens directly in CSS. <br />
✅ No PostCSS setup required — Tailwind runs natively through its own build engine. <br />
✅ Up to 100× faster builds — Thanks to the new Rust-based engine. <br />
✅ CSS-first approach — Themes and tokens can be defined using native CSS variables. <br />

### 🧰 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18+
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A modern frontend project (Next.js, React, or Vite)

If you don’t have one, you can create it using:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-project
# or
npm create vite@latest my-project
```

### 🪄 Step 1: Install Tailwind CSS v4

Run the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install -D tailwindcss@next
```

_(As of v4, the “next” tag is used until full stable release.)_

This installs the latest Tailwind v4 package and its new lightweight compiler.

### ⚙️ Step 2: Create Your CSS File

If you don’t already have one, create a CSS file for global styles, e.g. src/index.css or app/globals.css.

Then add these Tailwind directives:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

That’s it! ✨ <br />
You no longer need separate `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, and `@tailwind utilities` lines — Tailwind v4 bundles them automatically.
